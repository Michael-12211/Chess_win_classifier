Chess is a complicated game with a lot of moving parts that results in the web of possible moves growing extraordinarily quickly. While theoretically possible to deterministically determine if a position is a winning one, that process is far too intensive to be done in a reasonable manner. Instead, a machine learning approach can be applied to make predictions on potentially winning arrangements based on previous knowledge. For this study, the chess king-rook vs. king-pawn dataset was used to train a machine learning algorithm to predict if a board is in a winning configuration based on the location of pieces
